# Cash Flow Forecasting Model

Welcome to my Cash Flow Forecasting Model repository! In this project, I demonstrate my skills in building a cash flow forecasting model using both SQL and Python. The model aims to predict future cash inflows and outflows based on historical transaction data.

## Overview
The cash flow forecasting model is designed to provide insights into daily cash inflows and outflows, allowing businesses to anticipate their future cash positions. This repository includes implementations in both SQL and Python, offering flexibility for different environments.

## Project Structure
- `sql/`: Contains SQL scripts for implementing the cash flow forecasting model in a relational database.
- `python/`: Includes Python scripts for data manipulation, forecasting, and visualization.

## SQL Implementation
The SQL implementation aggregates transaction data and computes daily cash balances. It leverages the power of SQL for efficient data processing and aggregation.

## Python Implementation
The Python implementation uses the pandas library for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualizing the forecasted cash balances. It provides a flexible and dynamic approach to cash flow forecasting.

## Sample Data
The `sample_data.csv` file contains a generated dataset of 100 transactions with random dates, amounts, and transaction types. This dataset serves as a sample for testing and understanding the functionality of the cash flow forecasting model.

## Visualizations
The `python/` directory includes visualizations of the forecasted daily cash balances using matplotlib. These visualizations help stakeholders better understand the projected cash flow trends.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional features you'd like to add to the cash flow forecasting model, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
